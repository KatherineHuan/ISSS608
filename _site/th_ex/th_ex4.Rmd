# 1. Overview

With reference to Challenge 2 of [**VAST Challenge 2022**](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2022/), we are required to reveal the daily routines of two selected participant of the city of Engagement, Ohio USA. For the purpose of this take-home exercise, [**ViSIElse**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ViSiElse/index.html) and other appropriate visual analytics methods.

# 2. Data Preparation

## 2.1 Installing and loading the required libraries

Before we get started, it is important for us to ensure that the required R packages have been installed. If yes, we will load the R packages. If they have yet to be installed, we will install the R packages and load them onto R environment.

The chunk code on the right will do the trick.

```{r}
packages = c('scales', 'viridis', 
             'lubridate', 'ggthemes', 
             'gridExtra', 'tidyverse', 
             'readxl', 'knitr',
             'data.table', 'ViSiElse')
for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```

## 2.2 Importing the dataset

### read_csv

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
log1 <- read_csv('data/ParticipantStatusLogs1.csv')
