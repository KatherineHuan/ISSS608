# 1. Overview

In this project, we need to reveal the patterns of community interactions of the city of Engagement, Ohio USA by using social network analysis approach.

Processes include:
  - create graph object data frames, manipulate them using appropriate functions of dplyr, lubridate, and tidygraph,
  - build network graph visualisation using appropriate functions of ggraph,
  - compute network geometrics using tidygraph,
  - build advanced graph visualisation by incorporating the network geometrics, and
  - build interactive network visualisation using visNetwork package.

# 2. Required libraries and datasets

## 2.1 Load required packages

Before we get started, it is important for us to ensure that the required R packages have been installed. If yes, we will load the R packages. If they have yet to be installed, we will install the R packages and load them onto R environment.

Here four network data modelling and visualisation packages will be installed and launched. They are igraph, tidygraph, ggraph and visNetwork. Beside these four packages, tidyverse and [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/), an R package specially designed to handle and wrangling time data will be installed and launched too.

The chunk code on the right will do the trick.

```{r}
packages = c('igraph', 'tidygraph', 
             'ggraph', 'visNetwork', 
             'lubridate', 'clock',
             'tidyverse', 'graphlayouts')
for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```

## 2.2 Importing Data

There are two data sets needed. One contains the nodes data and the other contains the edges (also know as link) data.

In this step, we will import .csv into RStudio environment by using read_csv() of readr package.


```{r,echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
edges <- read_csv("data/SocialNetwork.csv")
nodes <- read_csv("data/Participants.csv")
```

It is always a good practice to examine the imported data frame before further analysis is performed.

Let's take an overview of the datasets, we will examine the structure of the data frame using glimpse() of dplyr.


```{r,echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
glimpse(edges)
glimpse(nodes)
```

# 3. Data Wrangling

## 3.1 Preprocess the Edges Data

```{r,echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
workdays <- c('Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday','Friday')

edges <- edges %>% 
  mutate(from = participantIdFrom,
         to = participantIdTo) %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(timestamp,
                        label = TRUE,
                        abbr = FALSE)) %>% 
  mutate(month = month(timestamp,
                       label = FALSE)) %>%
  mutate(week = lubridate::week(timestamp)) %>%
  mutate(when = case_when(weekday %in% workdays ~ "Working-day",
                          TRUE ~ "Weekends")) %>% 
  select(from,to,timestamp,weekday,week,when)
```

## 3.2 Preprocess the Nodes Data

**- Rename 'HighSchoolOrCollege'**

```{r,echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
nodes$educationLevel <- sub('HighSchoolOrCollege',
                            'High School or College',
                            nodes$educationLevel)
```

**- Rename columns**

```{r,echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

nodes <- nodes %>% 
  rename('ID' = 'participantId', 
         'HouseholdSize' = 'householdSize', 
         'HaveKids' = 'haveKids', 
         'Age' = 'age', 
         'EducationLevel' = 'educationLevel', 
         'InterestGroup' = 'interestGroup', 
         'Joviality' = 'joviality')
```


**- Age Binning**

Age variable is binned with the following code chunk:

```{r,echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
breaks <- c(17, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60)
groups <- c('20 & Below', '21-25', '26-30',
            '31-35', '36-40', '41-45',
            '46-50', '51-55', '56-60')
nodes$AgeGroup <- cut(nodes$Age, 
                      breaks=breaks, 
                      labels = groups)
```

**- Write and Read rds Files**

```{r,echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
saveRDS(edges, "data/rds/edges.rds")
saveRDS(nodes, "data/rds/nodes.rds")
```


```{r}
edges <- read_rds('data/rds/edges.rds')
nodes <- read_rds('data/rds/nodes.rds')
```


## 3.3 Network Data During Whole Period

**- The Edges Data**

```{r}
edges_aggregated <- edges %>% 
  group_by(from,to) %>% 
  summarise(Weight = n()) %>% 
  filter(from!=to) %>% 
  filter(Weight > 1) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

```{r}
hist(edges_aggregated$Weight)
```

Select edges with weight higher than 200.

```{r}
edges_aggregated <- edges_aggregated %>% 
  filter(Weight >200)
```

```{r}
glimpse(edges_aggregated)
```

**- The Nodes Data**

```{r}
nodes_aggregated <- nodes %>%
  filter (ID %in% c(edges_aggregated$from,
                    edges_aggregated$to))
```

## 3.4 Network Data in Working-days/weekends

**- The Edges Data**

```{r}
edges_byWork <- edges %>% 
  group_by(from,to,when) %>% 
  summarise(Weight = n()) %>% 
  filter(from!=to) %>% 
  filter(Weight > 1) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

```{r}
hist(edges_byWork$Weight)
```

```{r}
edges_byWork <- edges_byWork %>% 
  filter(Weight >100)
```

```{r}
glimpse(edges_byWork)
```

**- The Nodes Data**

```{r}
nodes_work <- nodes %>%
  filter (ID %in% c(edges_byWork$from,
                    edges_byWork$to))
```

set_graph_style()
g <- ggraph(graph_aggregated, 
            layout = "nicely") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.01, .5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = EducationLevel), 
                  size = 0.2) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')

g

g + facet_nodes(~EducationLevel) +
  th_foreground(foreground = "grey80",  
                border = TRUE) +

                border = TRUE) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```


## 4.2 Network during Working-days and Weekends

According to whether it's working day or weekends.

```{r}
graph_work <- graph_from_data_frame (edges_byWork,
                                           vertices = nodes_work) %>%
  as_tbl_graph()

graph_work
```

### 4.2.1 Social Network- Working/weekends & EducationLevel

```{r}
set_graph_style() 
g <- ggraph(graph_work, 
            layout = "nicely") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.01, .5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = EducationLevel), 
                  size = 0.4)
g

g + facet_edges(~when) +
  th_foreground(foreground = "grey80",  
                border = TRUE) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')

```



There are more connections,more social activities in working days.

```{r}
set_graph_style()
g <- ggraph(graph_aggregated, 
            layout = "nicely") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.01, .5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = AgeGroup), 
                  size = 0.4) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
g

g + facet_nodes(~AgeGroup) +
  th_foreground(foreground = "grey80",  
                border = TRUE) +
